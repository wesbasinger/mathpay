# Mathpay

This is a React app I wrote centered around use of a music server coupled with fake Dogecoin.  I was going to pay my students fake Dogecoin from the testnet (the backend program is written in Flask and Python).  Then they would log on to this front facing web app to spend their tokens.  I've never implemented it with kids, but the site should be live enough to login with a Google account and browse around.
